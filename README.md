## Project Overview
This project represents the front end of a decentralized lottery system. Key features of this project include:

1. **Fully Decentralized**: Our lottery system operates on a blockchain network, ensuring transparency, security, and trust.

2. **Regular Raffle Refresh**: Every 30 seconds, the lottery is refreshed, and a winner is randomly selected.

3. **Chainlink VRF Integration**: To ensure randomness and fairness, we have integrated Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to generate random numbers used to determine the winner.

4. **Chainlink Upkeep**: We leverage Chainlink's Upkeep functionality to run the lottery autonomously, eliminating the need for human intervention in the day-to-day operations.

## Features
- Buy lottery tickets with cryptocurrency.
- Periodic raffle draws every 30 seconds.
- Winners are selected fairly using Chainlink VRF.
- Transparency and security ensured through blockchain technology.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Our decentralized application (DApp) is built on a blockchain network, ensuring security and transparency.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are used to manage lottery ticket purchases and determine winners.
- **Chainlink VRF**: Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function is integrated for secure and fair random number generation.
- **Chainlink Upkeep**: Chainlink's Upkeep feature is used to maintain the lottery system autonomously.
- **Web3.js**: We use Web3.js to interact with the blockchain and smart contracts.
- **React**: The front end of the application is built using the React library.

## How It Works
1. Users buy lottery tickets using cryptocurrency.
2. The lottery system refreshes every 30 seconds.
3. Chainlink VRF is used to generate a random number.
4. The random number determines the winner of the lottery.
5. The lottery operates autonomously thanks to Chainlink Upkeep.
